description: Publish a new version of __GAME_NAME__ on itch.io (Unity build -> Butler push -> commit of the version number). To be invoked when the user asks to "publish", "release", "push to itch", "ship a new version". Chains the build, the push and the commit through tools/release_itch.ps1.

# Publish on itch.io -- __GAME_NAME__

Distribution: **itch.io + Butler** (`__ITCH_USER__/__GAME_SLUG__`). A `butler push` gives
auto-update to players on the itch app (wharf differential patch); web players are always up to
date, the page serving the current build. Detailed runbook: `docs/RELEASE.md`. The `release-manager`
agent does the same thing end to end, devlog included.

## Procedure (in order)

### 1. Choose the version number
Semantic `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. The current version is `bundleVersion` in
`ProjectSettings/ProjectSettings.asset` -- **do not edit it by hand**, the script sets it itself.
- **patch** (x.y.**Z**): bugfix, minor adjustment;
- **minor** (x.**Y**.0): new content, new mechanic;
- **major** (**X**.0.0): overhaul, breaking change.

If the nature is not obvious, propose the bump and carry on without blocking.

### 2. Commit everything BEFORE running the script
The build stamp (`v<version>-<sha>`) designates the published commit. A modified tree produces a
stamp suffixed with `+`, which matches **no commit** -- the script reports it, it does not prevent
it.

WARNING: **`Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` comes out modified at every build** (`SceneBuilder` renumbers
every `fileID`: thousands of diff lines for an identical scene). Discard it with
`git checkout -- Assets/Scenes/Game.unity`, **unless `SceneBuilder.cs` has changed**.

### 3. Dry run, then publication
From the root, **without `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`** (that flag is refused by the auto classifier
and makes the call fail):
```
& "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version X.Y.Z -DryRun            # goes as far as staging, publishes nothing
& "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version X.Y.Z                    # web channel (default)
& "tools/release_itch.ps1" -Version X.Y.Z -Target windows    # downloadable channel
```
Generous timeout: a WebGL build takes about ten minutes.

The script chains: `bundleVersion` set -> Unity build (regenerated scene included) -> check that the
build **really** carries the requested version -> clean staging -> `butler push` -> commit and push
of the version number.

Useful parameters: `-SkipBuild` (re-push of a build you have just built yourself -- the script
checks its stamp all the same), `-Channel`, `-Itch user/slug`.

### 4. Check
- Output: "Publishing OK - version X.Y.Z pushed". The `butler status` table may show the old version
  while the build is "processing" -- that is normal.
- Open the page and launch the game: the stamp at the bottom right must carry the published version.

## Prerequisites / pitfalls
- **The Unity editor must be CLOSED**, otherwise the command-line build fails.
- **Butler authenticated**: supplied by the itch app (`broth` folder, auto-detected). If "not
  authorized", run `"<butler.exe>" login` once (path printed by the script).
- WARNING: **a release has already shipped the binary of the PREVIOUS version.** Hence the stamp
  check: the script requires `build_stamp.json` to carry the requested version. Do not bypass it.
- WARNING: **the build date proves nothing**: Unity builds incrementally, an identical file is not
  rewritten. Only the embedded version settles it. (And the Windows metadata of a Unity `.exe`
  describes the **engine**, not the game.)
- WARNING: **never test `$?` after a native exe in PowerShell 5.1**: `git`, Unity and Butler write
  their progress on stderr even when all is well. Only `$LASTEXITCODE` is authoritative.
- WARNING: **the channel name decides whether the file is playable in the browser**: `html5` (or
  `html`, or `web`) is recognised as such, any other name produces an archive to download -- which
  installs perfectly and does not play. Nothing reports it.

## Prerequisites on the itch.io side, to do ONCE
- *Kind of project* = **HTML** (as long as the project is "Downloadable", the web build gets
  downloaded instead of played), and the file ticked **"This file will be played in the browser"**.
- The **Mobile friendly** checkbox, the **Classification** tab, the declared **orientation**: those
  three settings are in no file of the repo and must be checked by hand.

## After the release
Update `README.md` / `CLAUDE.md` and the store page text (`docs/ITCH_STORE_PAGE.md`) if the version
changes something visible. Devlog: written in `docs/DEVLOG.md`, then pasted on itch --
WARNING: **tick "Published"**, otherwise the post stays a draft without saying so.
